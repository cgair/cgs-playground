// type system isn't careful, it could accidentally make dangling pointers.

    struct Word<'a> {
        inspector: Option<Inspector<'a>>,
        days: Box<u8>

        inspector: None,
        days: Box::new(1)
    };
    // word.inspector = Some(Inspector(&word.days));   // 1. This program is totally sound and compiles.
                                                    // The fact that days does not strictly outlive inspector doesn't matter. 
                                                    // As long as the inspector is alive, so is days.
                                                    // 2. However if we add a destructor, the program will no longer compile!

// As far as the borrow checker knows while it is analyzing main, the body of an inspector's destructor might access that borrowed data.

In the meantime, there is an unstable attribute (may_dangle) that one can use to assert (unsafely) that a generic type's destructor is guaranteed to not access any expired data, 
even if its type gives it the capability to do so.
To deploy it on the Inspector from above, we would write:
