// Most of the time, we expect types to have a statically known and positive size. This isn't always the case in Rust.

/*
Dynamically Sized Types (DSTs)
Rust supports Dynamically Sized Types (DSTs): types without a statically known size or alignment.
* these types can only exist behind a pointer
There are two major DSTs exposed by the language:
    trait objects: dyn MyTrait
    slices: [T], str, and others

Zero Sized Types (ZSTs)
